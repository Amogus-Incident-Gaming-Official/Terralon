 # To-Do
 - Report issue with Create & Haema, Requiem, and Sync to respective developers, and/or find a version combination of those three that works together on Quilt so that we can use Requiem.
 - Fix the Fops Origin's scaling power.
 - Test all the AIGO Origins, RustRework modified Origins, and Bliss.
 - Create the modified version of Spectrum which gates its geodes behind Revelationary.
 - Remove Haema's Vampires from the Origins origin layer.
